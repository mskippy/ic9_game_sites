        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Block TD which is a tower defense game that is a subgenre of strategy games.
            The main goal of Block TD is to defend the base from enemies.
            To win Block TD you must use the troops in your inventory to defend against the enemies.
            After a certain amount of kills (dependent on the level), it will grant you a win screen.
            In my game there isn’t just a main character, there are multiple characters/troops 
            such as the Basic Turret, Advanced Turret, Basic Sniper, Advanced Sniper and Rocket Turret.

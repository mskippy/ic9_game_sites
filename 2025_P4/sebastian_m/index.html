    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>There was a village called Whitecliff, in this village there was a boy named Novael, he was a boy who lived happily with his family but the village had one single problem, they had no protection so monsters and bandits could nter the village easily. One day when Novael was hunting down for food, he found a small cave that was calling his name, he went inside the cave and found a book, he was confused why would a book be inside a cave so he went back to his village to show his parents, all he found were burning houses and dragons flying back to their habitad, Novael was devastated, he was shocked but he decided to follow the dragons, when he found the dragons nest he heard a voice telling him to open the book he was filled with memories and knowledge about magic, after he did he started training and decided to go inside the cave for revenge for the village.</p>

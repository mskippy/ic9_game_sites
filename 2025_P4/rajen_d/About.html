    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>
      My game is called Mario’s Adventures. It is a platform game that follows a lot of principles of the Super Mario Bros game. The goal of the game is to complete the levels while gaining score from objects and enemies from the map. To finish each level all you have to do is reach the end of each level and collide with the gold star. To finish, it is not required to collect a certain number of coins. 

The game setting is located outside on a grassy area. The scene in my game is similar to the scene in the Super Mario Bros game. The scene stays the same throughout all the levels. The time of the game is 80 years into the future when Little Mario’s dad is 100 years old.  

The main character in my game is Little Mario. Little Mario is seen in all levels diving his go kart from Super Mario Deluxe 8. He drives him go kart through all the levels because he wanted to see what his dad did back when his dad was younger. As well as driving the go kart is faster than running and walking, so he is able to see everything his dad did in quicker time. The reason Little Mario wanted to see what his dad went through was because his dad is getting older and so his dad told him to go on this adventure to remember him. On this adventure, Litle Mario comes across old enemies that want vengeance, like the Goomba,  and his dad's old friends which want to help him, like Toad. 

The gameplay mechanics are jumping, moving left to right, jumping onto enemies, avoid colliding with enemies, collecting Power ups, and avoiding Power downs. All these mechanics come into play if you want to survive all levels. In the How to Play menu in the game, it explains all the enemies and Power downs you want to avoid, and all the Power ups you want to get. 

The levels are designed to get harder each time as the lengths are increased for the level each time. This allowed more enemies and obstacles that would make it harder to complete. The speeds of the Goomba and Green Shell are increased to make it harder to get by them.

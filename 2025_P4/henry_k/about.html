                <p>
                    Frog Hop is a cheerful pixel-style platformer where you control George, a determined little frog on a mission to clear his debt.
                    Jump across floating platforms, avoid obstacles, and collect coins scattered through the world!
                </p>

            <div class="section-box">
                <h2>The World</h2>
                <p>
                    
                George's adventure takes him all across the world collecting coins.
                 Starting in the lush and calm jungle, George’s journey leads him through the fire filled Magma Caves to the freezing summit of the Snowy Mountain.

                <h2>George</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the game begins George has taken out massive loans from multiple banks to fund his crippling gambling addiction. 
To pay off his debts George must collect coins. George is trying to pay of his debts as soon as possible because the banks won't let him take out now loans in till he pays off his pre-existing debts.

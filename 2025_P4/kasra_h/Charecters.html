    <h3>Silent Knight</h3>
    <p>
        A member of the enslaved race known as the Quiet, the Silent Knight carries the weight of
        his people’s suffering. Trapped beneath the old mines where his ancestors labored, he follows
        the trail toward the magical key that could free his entire race. His silence is not weakness—
        it is discipline, forged from generations of pain and hope.

        <div class="character-box">
    <h3>Butterfly</h3>
    <p>
        A mysterious floating creature found deep within the mines. Though fragile and unmoving,
        the butterflies carry strange magical energy. The Silent Knight can use them to gain height,
        representing moments of hope that help him push through darkness.

        <div class="character-box">
    <h3>The Loud Boss</h3>
    <p>
        The final enforcer of the Loud, towering over the mines like a living reminder of the Quiet’s
        suffering. Once a Quiet himself, he was twisted and reshaped by the Loud’s magic, stripped of
        identity and rebuilt as a weapon. His purpose is singular: protect the magical key at any cost.
        His presence is a symbol of what happens when the Quiet lose themselves completely to the Loud’s control.
    </p>

<div class="character-desc">

        Larger version of the player. Moves left to right and fires projectiles that damage only enemies.

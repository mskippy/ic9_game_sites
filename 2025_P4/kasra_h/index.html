        <strong>Beneath The Quiet</strong> is a dark, atmospheric metroidvania game set in the ancient mines once controlled by the Quiet. These tunnels were once worked by thousands of enslaved Quiet, forced into endless labor under the rule of a powerful race known as the Loud. Their oppression was maintained through a single artifact — a magical Key capable of controlling the minds of the Quiet, binding their will and suppressing their voices.You play as the Silent Knight, a masked protector chosen by his people to descend into the depths and retrieve the Key. With it, the Quiet hope to finally break free from the Loud’s control. But when the Silent Knight reaches the chamber where the Key should be held, it has mysteriously vanished — and moments later, the ground collapses beneath him, sending him deeper into forgotten passages where something far older stirs.As you navigate the mines, you uncover the remnants of Quiet history, confront creatures corrupted by the Loud’s influence, and unlock abilities that reflect the Silent Knight’s struggle to break through generations of suffering.You must follow the trail of the missing Key, facing both physical and emotional obstacles, while piecing together why it disappeared — and who truly holds the power to free or destroy the Quiet.The adventure blends platforming, enemy timing, and story-driven exploration to create an eerie, quiet, and beautifully heavy experience.
